# NMSE - No Man's Sky Extender

### NMSE has gone into beta
With that there are a slew of new features. One of which allows everyone who is pretty familiar with reversing, cheat engine and or finding desired functions in x64 to both use this more efficiently and help me if they would like!

Follow this on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyMods/comments/4xq9ey/indevelopment_nms_extender/).

### Help wanted
I could use any pointer values of functions that you guys have reversed that you think are of any significance! Such pointers/functions would be: The player enter and exiting the ship, the player entering a warp mode, the game saving, etc etc.

If anyone would like to contribute what ever you have feel free to just email me graetgandalf@aol.com or whatever means you can contact (reddit etc etc).

#### Suggested format example:

- Function or Pointer? Pointer and Function

- Summary of use? Allows the HUD to be toggled on and off

- Function/Pointer addr: Pointer is at NMS.exe+???? and Function is at NMS.exe+???? (the function changes the pointer at NMS.exe+????)

- Version of the game: Latest Steam (as of 8/25/2016 -- I'll know what version it is probably)

- (Optional)Pattern/Signature: 78 89 45 25 a8 d6 f8 c9 45 xx xx xx etc etc (you can just do this instead of the above if you know how)

#### Description of the arguments:
  Here I would like you to describe what arguments it takes, if any, and what they mean at all. If you can't figure it out I will gladly take the above without this! I can figure them out pretty fast :)
